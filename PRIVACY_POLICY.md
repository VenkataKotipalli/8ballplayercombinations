8 Ball Combinations: Privacy policy

Welcome to the 8 Ball Combinations app for Android!

This is an Android app developed by Venkata Kotipalli. This app is available on Google Play.

I have developed this app to help APA league captains with different possible plays they can 
play with the input of skill levels of their team members. This app uses permutations and 
combinations algorithm to provide the combinations. 

This app doesn't collect any PII (Personal Identifiable Information) data. This app has one 
field for simple combinations which is skill level of a player. For advanced combinations, 
we have four fields out of which the name field of a player is restricted to only four characters.
And other fields correspond to skill level, career win percentage, and session win percentage.
None of these fields has any sort of PII data and all data is stored on your device only and 
can be erased by clearing the app data or uninstalling it.

The app doesn't have any libraries which may cause security vulnerabilities and it is merely 
a math library using permutations and combinations on given skill level. If any further questions
please send me an email and I will respond immediately.

Yours sincerely,
